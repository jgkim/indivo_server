Change Log
==========

Indivo Server
-------------

Features
^^^^^^^^

* New API calls to permanently delete app-specific documents and record-app-specific documents
* New API calls to rename and delete carenets
* Added Templates for activation, welcome, and forgot-password emails
* Performance fixes leading to an average 2x improvement in reporting calls.
* Large expansion of the Test Suite, including 80+ new tests, a new framework for loading test data, close to 9x faster test running time, and better management of testing transactional code.
* Better handling of database-level integrity errors
* Brand new documentation system written in Sphinx, with autogenerated API and source code documentation
* Reworked, neater settings file. MAKE SURE TO MOVE TO THE NEW FILE IF YOU ARE UPGRADING!!
* Added and tested compatibility with Django 1.3, python2.7, MySQL
* New reset script which avoids the need to drop/recreate the database every time
* New API calls to manage the autonomous app oAuth workflow

Behavior Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Many calls that used to cause 500 errors now return 400s. Examples:
  
  * Attempting to reuse external_ids on documents, records, or messages
  * submitting invalid documents when XML validation is turned on
  * creating accounts with duplicate emails
  
* All XML returned from API calls is now stripped of whitespace between tags 
* The 1-hour deletion rule for documents was removed: record-specific documents can NEVER be deleted.
* Document Status History now produces an iso8601 timestamp in the created_at field
* New Account email and username policy: all names are case insensitive.
* HTTP Methods are now enforced for all API calls. Making an API call with an unsupported HTTP method now results in an HTTP 405 error.
* The call to POST /records/{RECORD_ID}/shares/{OTHER_ACCOUNT_ID}/delete is deprecated. Use DELETE /records/{RECORD_ID}/shares/{OTHER_ACCOUNT_ID} (which is more RESTful) instead.
* The call to POST /records/{RECORD_ID}/notify is deprecated. Use POST /records/{RECORD_ID}/notifications/ (which is more RESTful) instead.
* The call to GET /id, which wasn't ever very useful, has been removed.
* The XML describing Messages (returned from calls to the account inbox or to fetch individual messages) now describes attachments' saved document ids  with the 'doc_id' attribute, which is only present if the attachment has been successfully saved.
* Dropped support for Django 1.1. MAKE SURE TO UPGRADE to 1.2+ when you move to the new release.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

* Template Rendering of Reports now includes all Doc metadata
* Procedure XSLT now captures correct value for 'location'
* Carenet filtering now works correctly with nevershares and implicit sharing
* Now enforcing unique message_ids per sender.
* DB errors due to failed unique constraints (i.e. duplicated external_ids) now return 400s not 500s
* Accepting Message attachment returns 400 on documents that don't validate, not 500
* API calls to invalid URLS now return 405 instead of a misleading 403
* Getting latest documents now sorts in the correct order
* Document metadata correctly renders the id of the document it replaces.
* Document Status History now produces an iso8601 timestamp in the created_at field
* Now attempting to version a document that isn't the latest version raises an error
* document creation by relationship now returns a 400 if the new doc fails validation, not a 404
* Paging of results is no longer nondeterministic when breaking ties on the primary ordering
* Attempting to assign the same name to two different carenets now returns a 400, not a 500
* Creating accounts with duplicate emails returns a 400, not 500
* Document Size is now calculated properly, and not overwritten when the doc is processed.
* Document Types are now assigned to all XML docs, even ones that don't match the core schemas
* Replacing Documents now updates their MIME types correctly
* Resolved inefficient DB access in reporting calls
* when XML Syntax Validation is on, now validates all documents, not just those that match core schemas
* HTTP Methods are now enforced for all API calls
* XML describing Indivo Messages now reports attachment size correctly, and renders dates in iso8601 format.
* XML describing Notifications now outputs dates in iso8601 format
* tests no longer fail if settings.MEDIA_ROOT hasn't yet been created in the filesystem
* Get-latest-document algorithm no longer relies on timestamps (which might be tied)
* Creating binary files no longer saves their content twice

Some Things You Should Know
===========================

* This release Drops support for Django 1.1. **MAKE SURE TO UPGRADE TO 1.2+** when you move to the new release.
* Because of licensing restrictions, we are not able to distribute SNOMED and UMLS concept codes, so the codingsystems functionality is not very developed right now.
